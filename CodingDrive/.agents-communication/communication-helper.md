## Communication Patterns

### Common Question Types
1. **Design Clarification:** When specs are ambiguous
2. **Technical Feasibility:** When implementation constraints exist
3. **Integration Requirements:** When components need to interact
4. **Performance Considerations:** When optimization is needed
5. **Security Requirements:** When security implications exist

### Best Practices
